# Todo List
Simple [TODO list website](https://nycrat.github.io/todo-list), made with MERN stack.  
Users are able to create and sign in to an account, any changes to the todo list will be saved to that account.  

The website's frontend is hosted with github pages, and backend is hosted with heroku. The website is a work in progress, this is the first deployment of it.
